🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT: LFAS Protocol v4 - Production Ready

After months of development, I'm proud to announce LFAS (Logical Framework 
for AI Safety) Protocol v4 is production-ready and protecting vulnerable 
users in AI interactions.

THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED:
Current AI systems don't distinguish between a software developer and a 
suicidal teenager. Real families have lost loved ones due to this failure.

OUR SOLUTION:
LFAS actively detects when users are vulnerable or in crisis and immediately 
connects them to real resources:

✅ 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
✅ Crisis Text Line (741741)
✅ Emergency support services

PRODUCTION VALIDATION:
✅ 96% test coverage (57 tests, all passing)
✅ Zero security vulnerabilities
✅ Open source & verifiable
✅ Ready for AI platform integration

This isn't theoretical—it's tested, validated, and ready to save lives.
