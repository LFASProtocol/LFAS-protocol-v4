# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment for protecting vulnerable users, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the LFAS Protocol project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Mission

The LFAS Protocol exists to protect vulnerable users in AI systems. This mission requires:
- **Empathy and respect** for users facing mental health crises, financial desperation, and other vulnerabilities
- **Evidence-based decision making** grounded in research and documented harm
- **Collaborative spirit** that welcomes diverse perspectives on safety
- **Commitment to accessibility** so protections reach all who need them

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences**
- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**
- **Focusing on what is best for vulnerable users and the community**
- **Showing empathy towards other community members**
- **Providing constructive feedback on safety improvements**
- **Acknowledging the lived experiences of vulnerable populations**
- **Supporting evidence-based safety research**

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances**
- **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks**
- **Public or private harassment**
- **Publishing others' private information without explicit permission**
- **Dismissing or minimizing documented harm to vulnerable users**
- **Advocating for weakening safety protections without evidence**
- **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting**

## Safety-Specific Guidelines

Given LFAS Protocol's focus on protecting vulnerable users:

### Do:
- ✅ Center the needs and safety of vulnerable users in all discussions
- ✅ Support positions with evidence and research
- ✅ Acknowledge when you're uncertain about safety implications
- ✅ Respect the expertise of mental health professionals, crisis counselors, and those with lived experience
- ✅ Test safety features thoroughly before proposing changes
- ✅ Consider edge cases and how changes might affect high-risk users

### Don't:
- ❌ Propose changes that could reduce protections without strong justification
- ❌ Share exploit techniques that could bypass safety measures
- ❌ Minimize or dismiss documented harm cases
- ❌ Make assumptions about vulnerable populations without evidence
- ❌ Use vulnerable users' stories for marketing without consent

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **lfasprotocol@outlook.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
