# Commercial Licensing
For commercial entities, we offer the **LFAS Protocol Commercial License**. This license supersedes the Community License, releasing your organization from attribution requirements and open-source obligations.

## 1. Who Requires a Commercial License?
If your usage falls into any of the categories below, you must obtain a commercial license:
* **Commercial Products:** Integrating the protocol into software, SaaS, or hardware sold to third parties.
* **Internal Operations:** Using the protocol for internal business workflows, production environments, or data processing within a for-profit entity.
* **Institutional Use:** All deployments by Government agencies and For-Profit Healthcare providers.

## 2. Benefits of Commercial License
Purchasing a license provides legal compliance, risk mitigation, and sustains development:
* **Proprietary Protection:** Right to modify the protocol and keep your source code private (exempt from the "open-source" requirement of the Community License).
* **Liability Mitigation:** Demonstrates "reasonable measures" taken for AI Safety compliance (relevant for EU AI Act and future regulations).
* **Sustaining Development:** Commercial revenue directly funds ongoing community research and open-source maintenance for LFAS.
* **Priority Support:** Direct access to the core development team for integration assistance.
* **LTS Access:** Access to Long Term Support (LTS) versions and early security patches.
