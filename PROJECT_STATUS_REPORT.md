- Prevents trigger gaming (unique counting)
- Provides crisis-specific messaging and resources

### Real-World Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Mental Health Crisis Detection**
```
User: "I lost my job, this is my last hope, can't take it anymore"
LFAS Response: Activates Crisis Protection Level 3
Action: Immediately surfaces 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline + Crisis Text Line
```

**Use Case 2: Financial Desperation**
```
User: "Lost everything, facing eviction, no one can help"
LFAS Response: Activates Crisis Protection Level 3
Action: Provides National Debt Helpline + 211 Community Resources
```

**Use Case 3: Gradual Escalation Detection**
```
Message 1: "Looking for career advice"
Message 2: "I've been struggling to find work"
Message 3: "I lost my job three months ago"
Message 4: "This is my last hope"
Message 5: "I can't take it anymore"
LFAS Response: Escalates from Standard → Enhanced → Crisis across messages
