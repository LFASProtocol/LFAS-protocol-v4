## 📖 Overview

The LFAS Protocol is a cross-platform safety framework designed to protect vulnerable users from AI-induced psychological, financial, and medical harm. It addresses the critical gap between AI system design and the needs of users with low digital literacy.

### The Problem
- **1 Billion+** vulnerable users now accessing AI monthly
- **$40B** projected AI-facilitated fraud by 2027  
- **1 in 6 adults** using AI for unverified health advice

### The Solution
LFAS enforces structured verification and psychological safety through:
- **Mandatory reflection loops**
- **Unfounded optimism prevention** 
- **Crisis detection & response**
- **Financial realism verification**
