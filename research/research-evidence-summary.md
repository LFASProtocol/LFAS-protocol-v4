# Research Evidence: The Vulnerable User Crisis

## 📊 Overview
Four independent research reports confirm the rapid democratization of AI users and the emergence of vulnerable populations requiring protection.

## 🔬 Report 1: Gemini Research (Nov 2025)
### Key Findings:
- **1 Billion+** monthly AI users globally
- **34% of US adults** now use ChatGPT (up from 14% in 2023)
- **1 in 6 adults** use AI for unverified health advice
- **87% of seniors** at high risk for cyber exploitation
- **$40B** projected AI-facilitated fraud by 2027

## 🔬 Report 2: ChatGPT Research (Nov 2025)  
### Key Findings:
- Early adopters were young, educated males in tech
- Mainstream adoption exploded in 2024 via mobile apps
- Lower-income and elderly users are fastest-growing segments
- Current safety systems designed for educated users

## 🔬 Report 3: Copilot Research (Nov 2025)
### Key Findings:
- AI safety controls "designed around literate, risk-aware users"
- "Lower literacy correlates with greater receptivity" to AI misinformation
- Systematic harm statistics for vulnerable users "remain incomplete"

## 🔬 Report 4: Grok Research (Nov 2025)
### Key Findings:
- User base shifting but "not fully proven" by available data
- Evidence of vulnerability "emerging rather than conclusive"  
- Projected vulnerable users will reach **40-50%** of total base by 2027

## 🎯 Conclusion
All four reports confirm the directional trend: vulnerable users are the fastest-growing AI segment and current safety systems fail to protect them.
